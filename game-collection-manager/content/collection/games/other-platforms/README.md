## Organization Strategies

### By Platform

### Individual Files
Keep all games as individual files in this folder if you have fewer games per platform.

## Retro Gaming Considerations
- **Condition is critical**: Retro games can be very valuable in good condition
- **Complete vs loose**: Track whether you have original box and manual
- **Reproduction vs original**: Note if games are reproductions or original releases
- **Regional variations**: Some games have significant regional differences in rarity/value

## Handheld Gaming Notes
- **Battery saves**: Some older games have internal batteries that may need replacement
- **Screen condition**: For handheld systems, screen quality affects value
- **Limited releases**: Many handheld games had smaller print runs
- **Import games**: Handhelds often had region-exclusive titles worth collecting

## VR Gaming Tracking
- **Platform requirements**: Note VR headset compatibility
- **Physical space**: VR games may have room-scale requirements
- **Motion controllers**: Track controller compatibility and requirements
- **Standalone vs PC**: Note if games are standalone or require PC connection
