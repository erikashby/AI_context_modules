## Notes
Incredible reinvention of the God of War series. The father-son relationship between Kratos and Atreus is beautifully developed. Single-shot camera technique creates amazing immersion throughout the entire game.

Currently on my second playthrough and appreciating details I missed the first time. The Norse mythology integration is masterful. Combat feels weighty and deliberate compared to the button-mashing of earlier games.

Runs beautifully on PS5 with enhanced graphics and loading times. Got this for an excellent price during a PlayStation sale. The game hits differently now that I'm a parent - the themes of legacy and teaching the next generation resonate more strongly.

Planning to play Ragnar√∂k after completing this replay. One of the best examples of how to successfully reboot a game series while respecting its origins.
