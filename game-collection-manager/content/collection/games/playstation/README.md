# PlayStation Games

Individual files for PlayStation games across all PlayStation platforms (PS4, PS5, PS3, etc.).

## Adding Games
Create a new file for each game using the template from `templates/game-entry-template.md`.

## File Naming Examples
- `god-of-war-2018.md`
- `spider-man-ps4.md`
- `horizon-zero-dawn.md`
- `the-last-of-us-part-2.md`

## PlayStation Considerations
- **Platform specificity**: Note exact platform (PS4, PS5, PS3) as compatibility varies
- **Digital ownership**: Track which PlayStation account owns digital games
- **Backwards compatibility**: PS5 plays most PS4 games, but not all
- **Upgrades**: Some PS4 games have free PS5 upgrade versions
- **Exclusives**: PlayStation exclusives tend to hold value and collector interest

## Multiple Editions
PlayStation games often have multiple editions:
- Standard Edition
- Deluxe Edition  
- Collector's Edition
- Game of the Year Edition

Include edition information in your game entries to track value accurately.

## Regional Considerations
- **Region locks**: Most modern PlayStation games are region-free
- **Import games**: Note if games are imports with different languages
- **DLC compatibility**: DLC must match game region on older PlayStation systems
