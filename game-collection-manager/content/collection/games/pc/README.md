# PC Games

Individual files for PC games across all digital platforms (Steam, Epic Games, GOG, etc.).

## Adding Games
Create a new file for each game using the template from `templates/game-entry-template.md`.

## File Naming Examples
- `cyberpunk-2077.md`
- `half-life-alyx.md`
- `the-witcher-3.md`
- `minecraft.md`

## PC Platform Organization
Consider organizing PC games by platform if you have many:
- `steam-games/` subfolder for Steam purchases
- `epic-games/` subfolder for Epic Games Store
- Individual files in main folder for games from multiple platforms

## PC Gaming Considerations
- **Platform exclusivity**: Note which platform(s) you own the game on
- **DRM vs DRM-free**: GOG games are DRM-free, others may require platform clients  
- **Multiple ownership**: You might own the same game on multiple PC platforms
- **System requirements**: Note if games have specific hardware requirements
- **Mods**: PC games may have modding potential that affects long-term value

## Digital Platform Notes
- **Steam**: Largest library, frequent sales, Steam Workshop support
- **Epic Games Store**: Regular free games, some exclusives
- **GOG**: DRM-free, classic game focus, installer backups
- **Origin/EA App**: EA games, subscription service integration
- **Ubisoft Connect**: Ubisoft games, achievement system

## PC Collection Strategy
- Digital games tied to accounts, not transferable
- Physical PC games increasingly rare and potentially valuable
- Track bundle purchases and multiple platform ownership
- Note games that work without platform clients (DRM-free)
