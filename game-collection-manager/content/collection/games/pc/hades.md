## Notes
One of the best roguelike games I've ever played. Perfect example of how to make failure feel like progress. The story integration with the gameplay loop is brilliant - every death advances character relationships and narrative.

Purchased during Steam winter sale and has provided incredible value. The game works perfectly on my PC (RTX 3070, runs at 144fps consistently). Perfect for both short 30-minute sessions and longer gaming marathons.

The voice acting and art style are exceptional. This game made me appreciate the roguelike genre for the first time. Highly recommend to anyone who typically avoids challenging games - the progression system makes it very approachable.

Steam achievements show 89% completion rate, which is unusually high for me with challenging games.
