# Nintendo Switch Games

Individual files for each Nintendo Switch game in your collection. 

## Adding Games
Create a new file for each game using the template from `templates/game-entry-template.md`.

## File Naming Examples
- `zelda-breath-of-wild.md`
- `mario-kart-8-deluxe.md`  
- `super-mario-odyssey.md`
- `pokemon-sword.md`

## Nintendo Switch Considerations
- Note whether games are physical cartridges or digital downloads
- Physical games: track cartridge and case condition separately
- Digital games: note which Nintendo account owns the game
- DLC: include information about downloadable content ownership
- Save data: Nintendo Switch saves are tied to user profiles, not games

## Valuable Nintendo Games
Nintendo first-party games tend to hold their value well. Pay special attention to condition for:
- Limited editions and special releases  
- Games that become hard to find
- Import games not released in your region
- Early Switch releases that may become collectible
