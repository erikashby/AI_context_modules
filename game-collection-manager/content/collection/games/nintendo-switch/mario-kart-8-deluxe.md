## Notes
Perfect party game and my go-to for family gaming sessions. The game has incredible staying power - we still play this regularly 7+ years after purchase. All DLC tracks purchased digitally.

Excellent condition with no visible wear. Box has been carefully stored and looks nearly new. This is probably my most-played Switch game for social gaming situations. The online multiplayer remains active and fun, though I primarily play local multiplayer with family and friends.

Essential Switch game that justifies its price through sheer replay value and social gaming experiences.
