## Notes
Launch day purchase that remains one of my favorite games ever. Currently on my third playthrough and still discovering new details. The exploration and physics system never get old. Minor cartridge wear from frequent swapping, but plays perfectly. This is the game that made me fall in love with the Switch as a platform.

The box art is pristine except for minor shelf wear on the edges. Includes original Nintendo eShop promotional materials. This copy has sentimental value as my first major Switch game purchase.
