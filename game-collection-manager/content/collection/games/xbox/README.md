# Xbox Games

Individual files for Xbox games across all Xbox platforms (Series X/S, One, 360, Original).

## Adding Games
Create a new file for each game using the template from `templates/game-entry-template.md`.

## File Naming Examples
- `halo-infinite.md`
- `forza-horizon-5.md`
- `gears-5.md`
- `flight-simulator.md`

## Xbox Considerations
- **Backwards compatibility**: Xbox has excellent backwards compatibility across generations
- **Game Pass**: Note if games are owned vs accessed through Game Pass subscription
- **Smart Delivery**: Some games automatically upgrade between Xbox One and Series X/S
- **Digital ownership**: Games tied to Microsoft account across devices
- **Cross-platform**: Many Xbox games also available on PC via Xbox app

## Xbox Ecosystem Benefits
- **Play Anywhere**: Some games can be played on both Xbox console and PC
- **Cloud gaming**: Games may be playable via cloud streaming
- **Cross-save**: Progress often syncs between platforms
- **Achievement continuity**: Xbox achievements carry across platforms

## Collection Strategy
- Xbox exclusives may have less collector value due to PC availability
- Physical games still valuable for collection completeness
- Consider Game Pass impact on physical game demand
- Focus on special editions and physical-only releases for collecting value
