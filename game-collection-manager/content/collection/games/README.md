# Game Collection

Your games are organized by platform, with each game as an individual file. This organization makes it easy for both you and your AI assistant to find, browse, and manage your collection.

## Platform Folders

- **`nintendo-switch/`** - Nintendo Switch games
- **`playstation/`** - PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and other PlayStation games
- **`xbox/`** - Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and other Xbox games  
- **`pc/`** - PC games from Steam, Epic Games, GOG, and other PC platforms
- **`other-platforms/`** - Retro consoles, handhelds, and other gaming systems

## File Organization

### Individual Game Files
Each game gets its own markdown file with a descriptive name:
- `zelda-breath-of-wild.md`
- `god-of-war-2018.md` 
- `halo-infinite.md`
- `cyberpunk-2077.md`

### Naming Guidelines
- Use lowercase letters
- Replace spaces with hyphens  
- Include year if needed to distinguish games (e.g., `doom-1993.md` vs `doom-2016.md`)
- Keep names searchable and recognizable

## Using Templates

Copy the game entry template from `templates/game-entry-template.md` when adding new games. This ensures consistent formatting and helps your AI assistant provide better recommendations.

## AI Assistant Capabilities

With this organization, your AI can:
- Browse entire platform libraries: "Show me all PlayStation games"
- Find specific games: "What condition is Mario Kart in?"
- Make recommendations: "Suggest an RPG to play"
- Compare across platforms: "Do I own Skyrim on multiple platforms?"

## Multi-Platform Games

If you own the same game on multiple platforms, create separate files in each platform folder:
- `nintendo-switch/skyrim.md`
- `pc/skyrim.md`
- `playstation/skyrim.md`

This helps track platform-specific details like condition, purchase price, and platform-exclusive features.
