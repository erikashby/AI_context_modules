## Special Considerations

### Limited/Collector's Editions
- **Mint condition is critical** for maintaining collector value
- **Missing components** (art books, figurines, DLC codes) significantly impact condition rating
- **Packaging condition** is more important than for standard releases

### Retro/Vintage Games
- **Age-appropriate standards** - some wear expected on older items
- **Working condition** is most important factor
- **Original packaging** adds significant value if present

### Regional Variations
- **NTSC vs PAL** affects compatibility and value
- **Region locks** impact usability
- **Import games** may have different value considerations

## Documentation Tips

### When Recording Condition
- **Be honest and consistent** - accurate descriptions help with value assessment
- **Note specific issues** - "minor scratch on disc" is better than just "good"
- **Update as needed** - condition can change over time
- **Include photos** for valuable items (store separately, reference in notes)

### For Selling
- **Use detailed descriptions** - buyers appreciate transparency
- **Conservative ratings** often better than optimistic ones
- **Highlight positives** - "complete with manual" for items in good condition
- **Disclose issues** - mention any functionality problems upfront
