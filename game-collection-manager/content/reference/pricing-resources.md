## Research Workflow

### For Buying Decisions
1. **Check multiple sources**: Compare prices across 3+ websites
2. **Consider condition**: Factor in condition when comparing prices  
3. **Include shipping**: Add shipping costs for fair comparison
4. **Check completion**: Complete-in-box vs loose pricing
5. **Timing consideration**: Can you wait for a better deal?

### For Selling Decisions
1. **Research recent sales**: Look at sold listings, not asking prices
2. **Assess condition honestly**: Use your condition standards guide
3. **Factor in fees**: eBay, PayPal, shipping costs reduce profit
4. **Consider timing**: Is this a good time to sell this particular game?
5. **Local vs online**: Compare local sale options vs online marketplaces

### For Collection Valuation
1. **Inventory by condition**: Separate by Mint/Good/Fair/Poor
2. **Use conservative estimates**: Better to underestimate than overestimate
3. **Update periodically**: Game values change over time
4. **Focus on valuable items**: Don't spend time researching $5 games
5. **Document for insurance**: Keep records of high-value items
