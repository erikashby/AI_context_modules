# Gaming Activity Tracking

Optional tracking of your gaming sessions, experiences, and reviews. Use as much or as little as works for your gaming habits.

## Activity Areas

### Play Logs (`play-logs/`)
Track when and what you play:
- **Monthly organization**: Files organized by year and month
- **Session logging**: Record gaming sessions with notes about progress and experiences  
- **Flexible detail level**: Choose between detailed session tracking or simple game time logs
- **Progress tracking**: Note achievements, completions, and memorable moments

### Reviews and Notes (`reviews-and-notes/`)
Longer-form thoughts about games:
- **Game reviews**: Personal opinions and detailed thoughts about completed games
- **Experience notes**: Memorable gaming moments, discoveries, recommendations for others

## AI Assistant Integration

Your AI can help with activity tracking:
- "Log that I played Zelda for 2 hours today"
- "What games have I been playing this month?"
- "Show me games I started but haven't finished"
- "What did I think about the last game I completed?"
- "Suggest something based on what I've been enjoying lately"

## Privacy and Personal Use

All activity tracking is for your personal use:
- Help remember gaming experiences and thoughts
- Make better purchasing decisions based on actual play habits
- Set and track personal gaming goals
- Share recommendations with friends based on actual experience

Choose the level of tracking that enhances rather than burdens your gaming enjoyment. The goal is insight and better decision-making, not perfectionist record-keeping.
