# Play Logs

Track your gaming sessions organized by month. Choose the level of detail that works for your style.

## Organization

### Monthly Files
- `2025/january.md`, `2025/february.md`, etc.
- One file per month for easy browsing and management
- Include both detailed sessions and quick play notes

### Session Template
Use the play session template from `templates/play-session-template.md` for consistent formatting.

## Logging Styles

### Detailed Logging
Perfect for games you're actively trying to complete or evaluate:
```
#### Session 1
- **Game**: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Switch)
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Activity**: Explored Hebra region, shrine hunting
- **Progress**: Completed 3 shrines, found Hebra Tower
- **Notes**: Love the snowy atmosphere, finally got cold resistance gear
```

### Simple Logging
Great for regular gaming without detailed tracking:
```
### Date: 08/25/2025
- **Zelda BOTW**: 2hrs - Shrine hunting in Hebra region
- **Mario Kart 8**: 45min - Online with friends, new DLC tracks
```

### Minimal Logging
Just track what you played:
```
**08/25**: Zelda (2hr), Mario Kart (45min)
```

## What to Track

### Helpful Information
- **Game and platform**: What you played and where
- **Duration**: Rough time spent (doesn't need to be exact)
- **Activity**: What you did - story, multiplayer, exploration
- **Progress**: Significant achievements or progress made
- **Thoughts**: Brief notes about the experience

### Don't Stress About
- **Perfect timing**: Rough estimates are fine
- **Every session**: Skip logging if it feels like work
- **Consistent format**: Use whatever level of detail feels right each day
- **Complete entries**: Partial information is better than none

## Benefits

### Short-term
- Remember what you were doing in long games when you return
- Track progress toward completion goals
- Notice gaming patterns and preferences

### Long-term
- See which games you actually spent time with vs just bought
- Make better purchasing decisions based on actual play habits
- Remember gaming highlights and experiences
- Reference past thoughts when considering sequels or similar games

## AI Assistant Help

Your AI can help with play logging:
- "Add that I played Zelda for 2 hours today working on shrines"
- "What games have I been playing this month?"
- "Show me my progress on games I'm trying to complete"
- "What was I doing last time I played [game]?"

## Monthly Review (Optional)

Consider adding a monthly summary:
- **Most Played**: Game that got the most time
- **Completed**: Games finished this month  
- **Started**: New games begun
- **Favorite Moment**: Memorable gaming experience
- **Next Month Goal**: What you want to focus on

Remember: The goal is to enhance your gaming experience, not create work. Use whatever level of tracking feels helpful and sustainable.
