# Game Reviews and Notes

Personal thoughts and experiences with games I've played, completed, or spent significant time with.

## Completed Games

### Hades (PC/Steam) - Completed January 2025
**Rating**: 9/10 | **Playtime**: ~45 hours | **Would replay**: Absolutely

**What Worked**:
The perfect gameplay loop - every death feels like progress, and the story unfolds naturally through repeated attempts. Combat is tight and responsive, with weapon variety that completely changes how you approach runs. The voice acting and character development is phenomenal, especially how relationships develop over time.

**What Didn't Work**:
Some weapon aspects feel significantly weaker than others, leading to "required" upgrades. The difficulty spike for higher heat levels can feel arbitrary rather than challenging.

**Personal Experience**:
Started this during a stressful period and found the "failure as progress" theme incredibly therapeutic. The game respects your time - even failed runs advance story and relationships. Became one of my favorite games to play in 30-60 minute sessions.

**Recommendation**: Perfect for anyone who enjoys challenging gameplay with incredible storytelling. Great for both short sessions and long binges.

### The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Switch) - Completed 2023, Replaying 2025
**Rating**: 10/10 | **Playtime**: 120+ hours across multiple playthroughs | **Would replay**: Already am

**What Worked**:
The sense of exploration and discovery never gets old. Even on replay, I'm finding new solutions to puzzles and hidden areas. The physics system creates endless experimentation opportunities. The art style ages beautifully.

**What Didn't Work**:
Weapon durability system remains divisive - I've made peace with it but understand the criticism. Rain stopping climbing can be frustrating when you just want to progress.

**Personal Experience**:
This game taught me to love exploration again. Playing it feels like being a kid and just wandering around, curious about what's over the next hill. Each playthrough reveals new details and possibilities.

**Recommendation**: Essential for anyone with a Switch. Even people who don't typically enjoy open-world games often connect with this one.

### God of War (2018) (PS5) - Completed 2022, Replaying 2025
**Rating**: 9/10 | **Playtime**: 35 hours | **Would replay**: Currently am

**What Worked**:
Incredible character development for both Kratos and Atreus. The single-shot camera technique creates amazing immersion. Combat evolution from hack-and-slash to strategic, deliberate encounters works perfectly. Norse mythology integration is brilliant.

**What Didn't Work**:
Some of the side content feels padded, especially certain collectible hunts. A few puzzle sequences drag on longer than necessary.

**Personal Experience**:
Replaying this after becoming a parent hits completely differently. The father-son relationship feels more authentic and emotional. The themes of legacy and change resonate more strongly now.

**Recommendation**: Must-play for anyone interested in excellent storytelling and character development. Combat is satisfying without being overwhelming.

## Currently Playing

### Cyberpunk 2077 (PC) - In Progress
**Current Thoughts** (as of January 2025):
Finally playing this after all the updates, and it feels like a completely different game than launch reviews suggested. Performance is solid, bugs are minimal, and Night City is genuinely impressive. The branching dialogue and choices feel meaningful.

**Progress**: About 15 hours in, focusing on main story with select side content.
**Expectation**: Likely to complete, enjoying the narrative focus.

## Abandoned Games (And Why)

### Assassin's Creed Valhalla (PC) - Abandoned after 25 hours
**Why I Stopped**: The game is simply too long without enough variety. Beautiful world and solid mechanics, but the formula became repetitive. Every region feels like the same activities with different scenery.

**What I Learned**: I need to be more selective about 100+ hour games. Even good games can overstay their welcome if they don't respect your time.

**Would Try Again**: Maybe, but only if I commit to just the main story without completionist tendencies.

---

### Dark Souls III (PC) - Abandoned after 8 hours  
**Why I Stopped**: The difficulty wasn't the issue - the lack of clear direction and cryptic storytelling didn't click with me. I prefer more guidance and context in my challenging games.

**What I Learned**: "Git gud" games aren't inherently bad, but they require a specific mindset and time investment I wasn't ready for.

**Would Try Again**: Possibly, but need to approach it differently - maybe with a guide for the first playthrough.

## Gaming Insights and Patterns

### What I've Learned About My Preferences

**Story vs Gameplay**: I need both, but lean slightly toward gameplay. Great mechanics can carry weak stories, but great stories can't save terrible gameplay.

**Session Length**: I prefer games that work well in 1-2 hour sessions. Games requiring 4+ hour commitments rarely get finished.

**Difficulty**: I enjoy challenge but need clear progress indicators. "Punishing but fair" works better than "figure it out yourself."

**Genres That Work**: Action-RPGs, platformers, puzzle games, and narrative adventures. Strategy games work but need to be turn-based.

**Genres That Don't**: Pure multiplayer competitive games, most fighting games, complex simulation games.

### Platform Preferences

**Switch**: Perfect for exploration games and indies. Portability makes it my most-used platform.
**PC**: Best for games with complex controls or that benefit from mods. Steam sales make it most cost-effective.
**PS5**: Excellent for cinematic exclusives and games that showcase advanced hardware.

### Buying vs Playing Reality Check

**Games I Buy But Don't Play**: Usually complex strategy games or very long RPGs. I'm attracted to depth but don't always have time to appreciate it.

**Games I Play Most**: Action games with clear progression, indie games with novel mechanics, comfort games I can replay casually.

**Best Purchases**: Games I can play in multiple contexts - both focused sessions and casual background gaming.
