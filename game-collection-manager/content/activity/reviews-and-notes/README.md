## AI Assistant Integration

Your AI can help with reviews and notes:
- "What did I think about the last RPG I completed?"
- "Show me games I rated highly but never finished"
- "What are my thoughts on From Software games?"
- "Remind me what I liked about cooperative games"

## Organization

### Single File Approach
Keep all reviews and notes in `game-reviews.md` with:
- Clear headings for each game
- Date when review was written
- Easy searching with game titles as headers

### Categories to Consider
- **Completed Games**: Full reviews of finished games
- **Abandoned Games**: Why certain games didn't work for you
- **Ongoing Impressions**: Thoughts on games you're currently playing
- **Revisited Games**: Updated thoughts on games you returned to

## Tips for Effective Reviews

### Write Soon After Playing
- Capture thoughts while they're fresh
- Include specific moments and experiences
- Note immediate emotional reactions
- Don't wait for "perfect" analysis

### Focus on Your Experience
- How the game made you feel
- What you learned or discovered
- How it compared to your expectations
- Whether you'd play it again or recommend it

### Include Context
- What was happening in your life when you played
- What you were looking for from the game
- How much time you had available to play
