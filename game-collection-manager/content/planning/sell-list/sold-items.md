## Sales Performance Analysis

### By Platform
- **eBay**: Average sale price $15, good for reaching wider audience
- **Local sales**: Average sale price $35, better prices but limited to local market
- **Game stores**: Average sale price $11.50, convenient but lowest prices

### Profit/Loss Summary
- **Total Sales Revenue 2025**: $53
- **Total Original Investment**: $100
- **Net Loss**: -$47
- **Average Loss per Game**: -$23.50

### Lessons Learned
- Sports games (FIFA, etc.) lose value very quickly - sell within 1-2 years
- FPS games (Call of Duty) also depreciate fast due to annual releases
- Controllers hold value better than expected, especially in good condition
- Local sales generally get better prices than online due to no fees/shipping

## Category Performance

### Games That Sold Well
- *Need to build this over time as I track more sales*

### Games That Didn't Meet Expectations
- Sports games: FIFA 2019 ($8 vs $20 expected)
- Annual franchises: COD games consistently lower than hoped

### Hardware Sales
- Controllers: Better value retention than games
- Consider timing hardware sales with new console releases

## Tax Record Information

### Important Notes for Tax Season
- Keep this record for capital gains/losses if applicable
- Most game sales likely qualify as personal property, not investment
- Consult tax professional for specific guidance on collection sales

### Sale Details for Records
All sales include:
- Item description and platform
- Sale price and date
- Buyer/platform information  
- Original purchase price for gain/loss calculation

## Future Selling Strategy

### Based on Performance Data
- **Timing**: Sell sports/annual games within 1-2 years of release
- **Platform choice**: Use local sales for higher-value items when possible
- **Pricing**: Be more realistic about game depreciation, especially for common titles
- **Hardware**: Controllers and accessories hold value better than expected

### Items to Watch
- Games I haven't played in 12+ months
- Duplicate games across platforms
- Hardware I have extras of
- Games with high current market value that I might not replay
