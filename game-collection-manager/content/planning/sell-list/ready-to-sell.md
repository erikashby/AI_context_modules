## Pricing Research

### The Witcher 3 (Switch)
- Recent eBay sold: $40-50 for mint condition
- Listed at $45 with Best Offer, hoping for $42+
- High demand due to portability factor

### Super Mario Odyssey
- Local market seems strong at $40-45
- Facebook buyer offered $40, negotiating to $42
- Avoiding shipping costs with local sale

### God of War (2018)
- eBay sold listings: $20-28 for mint condition
- Targeting $25, will accept $22+ 
- Popular game, should sell quickly

## Selling Platform Strategy

### eBay Listings
- Use auction format for rare items
- Buy It Now with Best Offer for common games
- Factor in eBay fees (~13%) and shipping costs
- Take high-quality photos, detailed descriptions

### Local Sales (Facebook/Craigslist)
- Price slightly higher since no fees/shipping
- Meet in safe, public locations
- Cash only, inspect item together
- Bring backup plan if buyer doesn't show

### Game Store Trade-ins
- Consider for bulk sales of lower-value items
- Trade-in credit usually higher than cash
- Good way to clear out multiple items quickly
