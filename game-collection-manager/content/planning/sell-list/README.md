# Sell List Management

Track games and hardware through your selling decision process from initial consideration to completed sale.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Considering (`considering.md`)
Games you're thinking about selling but haven't decided yet. Use this stage to:
- Research current market values
- Assess condition honestly
- Consider sentimental value vs financial return
- Think about whether you might play again

### 2. Ready to Sell (`ready-to-sell.md`)
Items you've decided to sell and are actively listing or preparing to sell:
- Set realistic asking prices
- Take photos and write descriptions
- Choose selling platforms (eBay, local, etc.)
- Track listing dates and responses

### 3. Sold Items (`sold-items.md`)
Historical record of completed sales for:
- Tax record keeping
- Performance tracking (profit/loss analysis)
- Learning what sells well and pricing lessons
- Insurance documentation

## Moving Items Through Stages

### From Collection to Considering
When you're thinking about selling something from your collection:
1. Add it to `considering.md` with current condition and market research
2. Keep the item in your collection until you decide
3. Use this stage to really think through the decision

### From Considering to Ready
When you decide to sell:
1. Move item from `considering.md` to `ready-to-sell.md`
2. Set target sale price and list where you plan to sell it
3. Remove item from your main collection files
4. Track listing progress and buyer interactions

### From Ready to Sold
When sale completes:
1. Move item from `ready-to-sell.md` to `sold-items.md`
2. Record actual sale price, buyer/platform, date
3. Calculate profit/loss vs original purchase price
4. Note any lessons learned for future sales

## Selling Tips

### Research and Pricing
- Check recent sold listings on eBay, not current asking prices
- Factor in fees: eBay (10-13%), PayPal (2.9%), shipping costs
- Price competitively but don't undervalue rare/good condition items
- Consider timing: holiday seasons, new game releases, etc.

### Condition Assessment
- Be honest about condition - use your condition standards
- Take clear photos showing any wear or damage
- Mention all included items (manual, box, DLC codes, etc.)
- Conservative condition ratings often better than optimistic ones

### Platform Selection
- **eBay**: Best for rare items, wider audience, auction options
- **Facebook Marketplace/Craigslist**: Local sales, no shipping, immediate payment
- **Game stores**: Quick but lower prices, good for bulk sales
- **Reddit/Discord**: Gaming communities, but requires trust building

### Safety and Best Practices
- Meet in public places for local sales
- Use tracked shipping for online sales
- Keep records of all transactions
- Trust your instincts about buyers

## AI Assistant Help

Your AI can assist with sell list management:
- "What should I consider selling?" - analyze collection for candidates
- "What's the market value of [game]?" - research current prices
- "Add [game] to my considering list" - help with workflow management
- "Show me items I haven't played in a while" - identify potential sell candidates

Remember: Only sell games you're confident you won't want to play again. It's often more expensive to repurchase later than to keep games you're unsure about.
