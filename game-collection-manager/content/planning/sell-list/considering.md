# Considering for Sale

Games and hardware I'm thinking about selling but haven't decided yet.

## Games Under Consideration

- **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare** (PS4) - Condition: Good | Paid: $60 | Market: $15 | Reason: Don't play FPS anymore, have newer games
- **FIFA 2020** (Xbox One) - Condition: Fair | Paid: $40 | Market: $8 | Reason: Have FIFA 2023, outdated sports game
- **Assassin's Creed Valhalla** (PC/Steam) - Condition: Digital | Paid: $60 | Market: N/A | Reason: Completed, very long game, unlikely to replay

## Hardware Under Consideration

- **PlayStation 4 Controller** (Extra) - Condition: Good | Paid: $60 | Market: $35 | Reason: Have enough controllers, showing slight stick wear

## Research Notes

### Call of Duty: Modern Warfare
- Checking recent eBay sold listings: $12-18 depending on condition
- GameStop trade-in value: $8
- Local game store offered $10
- **Decision leaning**: Sell - clear I won't play again

### FIFA 2020  
- Very low value due to annual sports game cycle
- Might be worth keeping for local multiplayer with friends who don't have newer version
- **Decision leaning**: Keep for now - low value but some utility

### Assassin's Creed Valhalla
- Digital game on Steam - cannot sell individual games
- Would need to consider account implications
- **Decision**: Keep - can't sell digital games individually

### Extra PS4 Controller
- Still functional despite minor wear
- Could be useful for local multiplayer
- Market value decent enough to consider selling
- **Decision pending**: Research if I really need 3 controllers

## Decision Criteria

### Sell if:
- Haven't played in over a year and unlikely to replay
- Have newer version or similar games that fill the same need
- Market value is reasonable compared to storage cost
- Not sentimental or rare/hard to replace

### Keep if:
- Might play again or lend to friends
- Market value too low to justify selling effort
- Part of a series I'm collecting
- Sentimental value or unique gaming memories

## Next Steps

1. **Call of Duty MW**: Move to ready-to-sell, research best selling platform
2. **FIFA 2020**: Keep for now, revisit when FIFA 2024 releases  
3. **AC Valhalla**: Remove from consideration - can't sell digital
4. **PS4 Controller**: Test with friends during next game night, decide based on usage

## Usage Notes

- Use this list to really think through selling decisions
- Research current market values before moving to ready-to-sell
- Consider non-financial factors: sentimental value, replacement cost, storage space
- Don't rush decisions - it's often more expensive to rebuy than to keep
- Move items to ready-to-sell only when you're confident in the decision
