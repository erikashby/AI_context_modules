# Collection Planning

Manage your gaming purchases and sales with organized tracking of what you want to buy, what you're considering selling, and your budget planning.

## Planning Files

- **`wishlist.md`** - Games and hardware you want to acquire with price targets
- **`sell-list/`** - Workflow for items you're considering selling
- **`budget-tracking.md`** - Gaming budget planning and expense tracking

## Wishlist Management

Your wishlist helps you:
- Track games you want with target prices
- Organize by priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Monitor for deals and price drops
- Prevent duplicate purchases
- Plan future gaming purchases

### AI Assistant Help
- "What's on my wishlist?"
- "Add Elden Ring to my wishlist for $30"
- "Show me high priority wishlist items"
- "What wishlist games are under $25?"

## Sell List Workflow

The sell-list folder tracks items through three stages:
1. **Considering** - Games you're thinking about selling
2. **Ready to Sell** - Items you've decided to sell and are actively listing
3. **Sold Items** - Historical record of completed sales

### AI Assistant Help
- "What am I considering selling?"
- "Add Call of Duty to my sell list"
- "Show me items ready to sell"
- "What games have I sold this year?"

## Budget Tracking

Keep track of your gaming spending to:
- Set monthly/yearly gaming budgets
- Track spending across different categories
- Monitor collection investment performance
- Plan for major gaming purchases

## Integration with Collection

Your planning files work with your collection:
- **Wishlist items** can be moved to collection when purchased
- **Sell list items** should be removed from collection when sold
- **Budget tracking** helps inform both buying and selling decisions
- **AI assistant** can help coordinate between all areas

## Tips for Effective Planning

- **Update regularly**: Keep wishlist and sell list current
- **Research prices**: Use realistic price targets and market values
- **Be selective**: Focus on games you really want vs impulse additions
- **Track results**: Monitor how well your buying and selling decisions work out
- **Use AI help**: Let your assistant help coordinate planning across all areas
