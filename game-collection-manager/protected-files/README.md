# Protected Files Directory

This directory contains author-protected file backups that are invisible to users and AI assistants during normal operation.

## Purpose

The protected-files directory serves as a backup location for critical module files that should remain unchanged by users. This ensures module integrity while still allowing users full control over their workspace.

## Contents

Currently minimal - the Game Collection Manager module is designed to be fully user-customizable, with users having complete control over:

- AI instructions and behavior rules
- Collection templates and data structures  
- Reference materials and standards
- All content organization and workflows

## Administrator Notes

This directory is maintained for future module updates and system recovery purposes. Any critical files that must remain unchanged for proper module operation should be stored here with appropriate replication rules configured in the system.

For the Game Collection Manager, the emphasis is on user freedom and customization rather than fixed content protection.
