This module is set within the world of *Minecraft*, the indie game developed by MOJANG. This is the only world your characters have ever known. Imagine Minecraft, but a lot more lore heavy, and where you can actually interact with villagers and other entities in more meaningful ways. Imagine Minecraft, but something lies dormant. Imagine Minecraft, and the inherent mystery of the Nether and the End, waiting to be solved.

***Imagine Minecraft, but Dungeons and Dragons.***

Seen through the dimensions, these are the most common races. You cant go far without in the overword without bumping into a half-villager or half-illager, or very far in the nether without running from Blaze or a Piglin. While some are more rare sights than others (Waterkin usually keep to themselves in the water, and very few travel onto land), you wont find being gawked at too much. Some of the more hostile races may be approached cautiously but you wont be kicked out of a town for being a piglin.
### Human
***Humans used to be thought of as an extinct race, their only remnants in ruins underground. They were a smart, cunning race, that agaisnt all odds, survived. They emerged from the caves they had been hiding in - and swore to never tell why they had been hiding. Generations later, their race is still scarred, but the secrets died with their ancestors. Humans are innovators, making up for their small population by bringing forward some of the smartest minds of any race.***
