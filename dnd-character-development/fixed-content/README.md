# Fixed-Content Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains **backup copies** of critical files from the `content/` folder that we want to ensure are maintained in case the user accidentally deletes important files.

## Important Notes

- **AI clients never see this folder** - It's invisible to users and AI assistants
- **For system maintenance only** - Used by administrators for file restoration
- **Backup storage** - Contains essential files we don't want to lose
- **Not user-editable** - Users work entirely in the `content/` workspace

## Contents

This folder may contain backup copies of:
- Essential AI instruction files
- Important template files
- Critical reference materials
- Core project structure files

## Restoration Process

If a user accidentally deletes important files from their `content/` workspace, administrators can restore them from the backups stored here.

## Maintenance

- Keep this folder synchronized with essential files from `content/`
- Update backup copies when core files are modified
- Remove backup files that are no longer needed

**Note**: Users work exclusively in the `content/` directory. This `fixed-content/` directory is for system backup purposes only.
