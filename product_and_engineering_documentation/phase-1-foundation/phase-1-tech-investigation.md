# Phase 1 Tech Investigation

## Overview
This document captures the technical investigation and research needed to validate the feasibility and approach for the AI Context Service (ConaaS) MVP.

## Investigation Areas

### 1. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Research
- [ ] MCP specification and current status
- [ ] Available MCP tools and SDKs
- [ ] Integration patterns with major AI assistants
- [ ] Performance characteristics and limitations

#### Questions for Product Manager Consultation

**Remote Service Architecture:**
1. Do Claude and ChatGPT currently support connecting to remote MCP servers, or only local installations?  >> Yes, they do. Please see documentation for remote MCP servers
2. What authentication mechanisms are supported for remote MCP connections? Google Accounts
3. Are there any known limitations with remote MCP vs local MCP that affect user experience?  This is unknown,  This is why we are doing this explore.  Plan is to work with enginering to have them built a remote prototype so we can see how this works
4. What's the expected latency tolerance for remote MCP calls from AI assistants? Less than 5 seconds right now. Howeve rthis is not critical for this investigation

**Market Positioning:**
>> Note Phase-1 foundation is about techinical feasibility but we will answer these questions anyway

5. Should we position as MCP-first (requiring MCP-compatible AI assistants) or build fallback mechanisms for non-MCP clients?  (No, this is an MCP service.  MCP is taking over quickly as the AI world so we are going forward. with this.)
   
6. What's the competitive advantage of being MCP-native vs building custom integrations? (We can support multiple AI assisntants not just one)
7. How important is it to support both Claude and ChatGPT simultaneously in MVP? Very, this is the proof that this model is an open model.

**User Experience:**
8. How complex can the setup process be for users to connect their AI assistants to our remote service? (This does not matter, right now this is a tech inviestigation to see if it spossoble.)
9. Should we provide our own AI assistant interface or rely entirely on users' existing AI tools? Existin AI tools.  The whole point is to expose this functionaly as far as possoble.  If we try to build our own AI tools then we end up competing with OpenAI Chat GPT or others.
10. What happens if MCP connection fails - do we need graceful degradation? Then this business idea is not feasible.  Hence why this is phase 1 tech investigation.

#### Technical Investigation

**1.1 MCP Specification Status**
- [x] Current MCP version and stability
- [x] Official documentation completeness
- [x] Breaking changes in roadmap
- [x] Community adoption metrics

**Research Results:**

**Current Version & Stability:**
- **Latest Version**: 2025-06-18 (current stable release)
- **Protocol Foundation**: Built on JSON-RPC 2.0 with well-defined client-server architecture
- **Maturity Level**: Production-ready with major enterprise adoption (Block, Replit, Sourcegraph, Zed)
- **Version History**: 
  - 2024-11-05: Initial stable release
  - 2025-03-26: Major update with OAuth 2.1 and transport improvements
  - 2025-06-18: Latest with enhanced security and structured tool output

**Breaking Changes & Risk Assessment:**
- **Recent Breaking Changes** (2025-03-26 to 2025-06-18):
  - Removed JSON-RPC batching support
  - Required Resource Indicators (RFC 8707) for clients
  - Changed lifecycle operations from "SHOULD" to "MUST"
- **Risk Level**: **Medium** - Protocol is stabilizing but still evolving with breaking changes every 3-6 months
- **Mitigation**: Plan for regular updates and version compatibility testing

**Official Documentation:**
- **Quality**: Comprehensive with formal specification at modelcontextprotocol.io
- **SDKs Available**: Python, TypeScript, C#, Java with official support
- **Status**: Well-documented with clear implementation guides and examples

**Community Adoption:**
- **Ecosystem Size**: 5,000+ public MCP servers on GitHub
- **Download Metrics**: 6.6M+ monthly Python SDK downloads
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Block, Replit, Sourcegraph, Zed, Codeium integrated
- **AI Assistant Support**: Claude Desktop (native), OpenAI ChatGPT (March 2025), Google Gemini (confirmed April 2025)

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP with OAuth 2.1 authorization
- **Message Format**: JSON-RPC 2.0 with structured tool outputs
- **Core Primitives**: Resources (context/data), Tools (functions), Prompts (templates)
- **Security**: OAuth Resource Server classification, end-to-end encryption support

**1.2 Remote MCP Server Capabilities**
- [x] Remote server implementation patterns
- [x] Authentication and authorization options
- [x] Connection persistence and reliability
- [x] Error handling and retry mechanisms

**Research Results:**

**Implementation Patterns:**
- **Two Primary Architectures**:
  - **Embedded Authorization Server**: MCP server acts as Identity Provider
  - **External Authorization Server**: MCP server delegates OAuth to external provider (recommended)
- **Framework Options**: Express.js, Cloudflare Workers, Node.js-based implementations
- **Deployment Platforms**: Google Cloud Run, Vercel, Railway, Cloudflare Workers

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- **OAuth 2.1 + PKCE**: Required by 2025-06-18 spec
- **Resource Server Classification**: MCP servers classified as OAuth Resource Servers
- **Discovery Endpoints**: Must implement `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
- **Resource Indicators (RFC 8707)**: Required to prevent token misuse
- **User-Specific Authorization**: Dynamic tool exposure based on user roles/permissions
- **Google Account Integration**: Product confirmed Google Accounts as auth mechanism

**Connection Persistence & Reliability:**
- **Transport Evolution**: Transitioning from HTTP+SSE to Streamable HTTP
  - **HTTP+SSE (Legacy)**: Requires persistent connections, limits serverless scaling
  - **Streamable HTTP (Current)**: Stateless, better for serverless deployment
- **Session Management**: 
  - Unique session IDs per client
  - Durable Objects for persistent state (Cloudflare)
  - In-memory session tracking for most use cases
- **Scalability Limitations**: No built-in load balancing or failover mechanisms

**Error Handling & Retry Mechanisms:**
- **Client-Side Retry**: Currently depends on MCP client (Claude Desktop, etc.)
- **Recommended Retry Strategy**:
  - Max retries: 3
  - Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s...
  - Transient error detection (network issues, timeouts)
- **Current Gap**: No standardized retry configuration across clients
- **Session Cleanup**: Timeout mechanisms needed for abandoned sessions

**Risk Assessment for Remote Service:**
- **✅ Feasibility**: Confirmed - both Claude and ChatGPT support remote MCP servers
- **⚠️ Complexity**: OAuth 2.1 implementation adds authentication complexity
- **⚠️ Reliability**: No built-in failover/load balancing requires custom solutions
- **⚠️ Transport Transition**: Supporting both HTTP+SSE and Streamable HTTP during transition period

**Recommended Implementation Approach:**
1. **External OAuth Provider**: Use Auth0, Google, or WorkOS for authentication
2. **Streamable HTTP Transport**: Focus on new transport for better scalability
3. **Session State Management**: Implement timeout and cleanup mechanisms
4. **Custom Retry Logic**: Build retry mechanisms into our server implementation
5. **Multi-Transport Support**: Support both transports during transition period
