# Phase 1 Tech Investigation

## Overview
This document captures the technical investigation and research needed to validate the feasibility and approach for the AI Context Service (ConaaS) MVP.

## Investigation Areas

### 1. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Research
- [ ] MCP specification and current status
- [ ] Available MCP tools and SDKs
- [ ] Integration patterns with major AI assistants
- [ ] Performance characteristics and limitations

### 2. Context Storage Architecture
- [ ] Schema design for structured context data
- [ ] Database options and trade-offs
- [ ] Scalability requirements and constraints
- [ ] Data synchronization strategies

### 3. Integration Capabilities
- [ ] Calendar API integration (Google, Outlook, etc.)
- [ ] Email integration possibilities
- [ ] Project management tool connections
- [ ] Authentication and security patterns

### 4. Performance Requirements
- [ ] Sub-200ms context retrieval targets
- [ ] Concurrent user handling
- [ ] Data freshness requirements
- [ ] Caching strategies

### 5. Security and Privacy
- [ ] End-to-end encryption implementation
- [ ] Data sovereignty options
- [ ] Compliance requirements (GDPR, etc.)
- [ ] Access control and permissions

## Key Questions to Answer
1. Is MCP mature enough for production use?
2. What's the minimum viable context schema?
3. Which integrations provide the highest value?
4. What are the technical risks and mitigation strategies?
5. What's the realistic timeline for MVP development?

## Investigation Process
- [ ] Literature review and documentation analysis
- [ ] Proof of concept development
- [ ] Performance testing and benchmarking
- [ ] Security assessment
- [ ] Integration feasibility testing

## Deliverables
- [ ] Technical architecture recommendation
- [ ] MVP scope definition
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation plan
- [ ] Development timeline estimate
- [ ] Technology stack selection
