# Phase 1 Tech Investigation

## Overview
This document captures the technical investigation and research needed to validate the feasibility and approach for the AI Context Service (ConaaS) MVP.

## Investigation Areas

### 1. Model Context Protocol (MCP) Research
- [ ] MCP specification and current status
- [ ] Available MCP tools and SDKs
- [ ] Integration patterns with major AI assistants
- [ ] Performance characteristics and limitations

#### Questions for Product Manager Consultation

**Remote Service Architecture:**
1. Do Claude and ChatGPT currently support connecting to remote MCP servers, or only local installations?  >> Yes, they do. Please see documentation for remote MCP servers
2. What authentication mechanisms are supported for remote MCP connections? Google Accounts
3. Are there any known limitations with remote MCP vs local MCP that affect user experience?  This is unknown,  This is why we are doing this explore.  Plan is to work with enginering to have them built a remote prototype so we can see how this works
4. What's the expected latency tolerance for remote MCP calls from AI assistants? Less than 5 seconds right now. Howeve rthis is not critical for this investigation

**Market Positioning:**
>> Note Phase-1 foundation is about techinical feasibility but we will answer these questions anyway

5. Should we position as MCP-first (requiring MCP-compatible AI assistants) or build fallback mechanisms for non-MCP clients?  (No, this is an MCP service.  MCP is taking over quickly as the AI world so we are going forward. with this.)
   
6. What's the competitive advantage of being MCP-native vs building custom integrations? (We can support multiple AI assisntants not just one)
7. How important is it to support both Claude and ChatGPT simultaneously in MVP? Very, this is the proof that this model is an open model.

**User Experience:**
8. How complex can the setup process be for users to connect their AI assistants to our remote service? (This does not matter, right now this is a tech inviestigation to see if it spossoble.)
9. Should we provide our own AI assistant interface or rely entirely on users' existing AI tools? Existin AI tools.  The whole point is to expose this functionaly as far as possoble.  If we try to build our own AI tools then we end up competing with OpenAI Chat GPT or others.
10. What happens if MCP connection fails - do we need graceful degradation? Then this business idea is not feasible.  Hence why this is phase 1 tech investigation.

- [ ] Access control and permissions

## Key Questions to Answer
1. Is MCP mature enough for production use?
2. What's the minimum viable context schema?
3. Which integrations provide the highest value?
4. What are the technical risks and mitigation strategies?
5. What's the realistic timeline for MVP development?

## Investigation Process

- [ ] Proof of concept development
- [ ] Performance testing and benchmarking
- [ ] Security assessment
- [ ] Integration feasibility testing

## Deliverables
- [ ] Technical architecture recommendation
- [ ] MVP scope definition
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation plan
- [ ] Development timeline estimate
- [ ] Technology stack selection
