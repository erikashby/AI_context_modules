# Phase 1 Product and Engineering Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the technical approach for Phase 1: Foundation of the AI Context Service. The goal is to build three progressive MVPs that demonstrate increasing levels of functionality and readiness for market validation.

## MVP Strategy

### 1. Core MVP - Technology Demonstration
**Goal**: Demonstrate end-to-end technology for a single use case suitable for demos

**Key Features**:
- Single use case implementation (to be defined)
- Basic MCP server functionality
- Core context storage and retrieval
- Minimal AI integration
- Demo-ready interface

**Success Criteria**:
- Functional demo of core concept
- Sub-200ms context retrieval
- Stable demonstration environment
- Clear value proposition showcase

**Deliverables**:
- Working prototype with single use case
- Demo script and materials
- Basic documentation
- Performance benchmarks

### 2. Technical MVP - Service Architecture
**Goal**: Build base architecture with authentication so users can sign-in and use the service

**Key Features**:
- User authentication and management
- Secure API endpoints  
- Basic user interface
- Single use case fully implemented
- Data persistence and security
- Deployment infrastructure

**Success Criteria**:
- Users can register and authenticate
- Service deployed and accessible
- Data security and privacy implemented
- Monitoring and logging in place
- API documentation complete

**Deliverables**:
- Production-ready service architecture
- User authentication system
- API documentation
- Security and privacy implementation
- Deployment and monitoring setup

### 3. Market MVP - Customer-Ready Product
**Goal**: Fully functional MVP with at least 2 use cases for real customer demonstrations

**Key Features**:
- Multiple use cases (minimum 2)
- Polished user experience
- Customer onboarding flow
- Usage analytics and feedback collection
- Integration with multiple AI platforms
- Customer support infrastructure

**Success Criteria**:
- External users can successfully onboard
- Multiple use cases demonstrate value
- Positive user feedback and engagement
- Ready for customer demonstrations
- Scalable architecture validated

**Deliverables**:
- Multi-use case product
- Customer onboarding system
- Usage analytics dashboard
- Customer feedback collection
- Integration documentation
- Go-to-market materials

## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Core Components
- MCP Server implementation
- Context schema design
- Data storage and retrieval system
- AI platform integrations
- User interface and experience

### Technology Stack
- To be determined based on requirements
- Consider scalability and performance needs
- Integration capabilities with existing AI platforms
- Security and privacy requirements

### Development Approach
- Iterative development with user feedback
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Security-first design principles

## Success Metrics

### Core MVP
- Demo completion rate: 100%
- Context retrieval performance: <200ms
- System uptime during demos: 99%+

### Technical MVP  
- User registration success rate: >95%
- API response time: <500ms
- System availability: 99.5%+

### Market MVP
- User onboarding completion: >80%
- Multi-use case adoption: >60%
- User satisfaction score: >4.0/5.0
- Customer demo conversion: >50%

## Next Steps

1. Define specific use cases for each MVP
2. Create detailed technical specifications
3. Establish development timeline and milestones
4. Set up development environment and tools
5. Begin Core MVP development

## Risk Mitigation

- Start with simplest viable use case
- Build incrementally with frequent validation
- Maintain focus on core value proposition
- Plan for technical debt management
- Establish clear success/failure criteria for each MVP
