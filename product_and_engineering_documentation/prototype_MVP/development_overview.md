# AI Context Service MVP Development Overview
**Phase 1: 5-Hour Development Sprint**
*Date: July 29, 2025*
*Prepared by: Claude (AI Engineering Manager)*
*Approved by: Erik Ashby (CEO)*

## Development Philosophy

This MVP follows a **bottom-up, independent component** approach where each step delivers a working, testable system that the next step builds upon. All components are designed for file system-based architecture with sub-200ms performance requirements.

## Three-Step Development Sequence

### Step 1: Context Data System
**Foundation Layer - File System Operations**

**Purpose:** Create the core file system foundation that stores user data, manages authentication, and handles module-based project instantiation.

**Core Components:**
- User folder management with authentication keys
- Module template system for project blueprints
- Project instantiation engine
- File system CRUD operations

**Key Deliverables:**
- Base folder structure: `/ai-context-service/users/`, `/modules/`
- User creation and key generation system
- Module template engine with variable processing
- First working module: `personal-planning-v1`
- CLI testing tool for validation

**Test Criteria:**
- Creates new users with unique authentication keys
- Instantiates projects from module templates
- Validates complete folder structures
- Processes template variables correctly

### Step 2: MCP Server
**Integration Layer - Context Protocol**

**Purpose:** Implement Model Context Protocol server that connects AI assistants to the file system data with authentication and optimized performance.

**Core Components:**
- MCP protocol implementation using TypeScript SDK
- Authentication middleware for user validation
- Context retrieval with <200ms response times
- Context modification tools for AI assistants

**Key Deliverables:**
- Working MCP server with full protocol compliance
- User authentication against file system keys
- Resource endpoints for project and context data
- Tools for project creation and context updates
- Performance optimization with caching

**Test Criteria:**
- MCP client successfully connects and authenticates
- Context retrieval responds within 200ms
- AI assistants can create and modify projects
- All operations maintain user isolation

### Step 3: Web Portal
**User Interface Layer - Management & Browsing**

**Purpose:** Provide user signup, account management, and read-only context browsing to complete the end-to-end user experience.

**Core Components:**
- User registration and onboarding flow
- Authentication integration with file system
- Project browsing and context visualization
- Dashboard for user overview

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete user signup flow with key generation
- Authentication system integrated with data layer
- Read-only project and context browsing
- Project creation from available modules
- User dashboard and account settings

**Test Criteria:**
- Complete user journey from signup to browsing
- Successful integration with MCP server
- Context visualization matches file system data
- End-to-end demo functionality

## Technical Architecture

### File System Structure
```
/ai-context-service/
├── modules/                    # Module templates (shared)
│   ├── personal-planning-v1/
│   ├── health-v1/
│   └── work-project-v1/
├── users/                      # User-specific data
│   ├── {username}/
│   │   ├── auth/
│   │   │   └── user.key       # Authentication key
│   │   ├── projects/          # User's project instances
│   │   └── profile/           # User preferences
└── system/                    # System configuration
```

### Technology Stack
- **MCP Server:** Node.js/TypeScript with @modelcontextprotocol/sdk-typescript
- **Web Portal:** Modern web framework (React/Next.js or similar)
- **Data Layer:** Native file system operations with `fs/promises`
- **Authentication:** Simple username/key validation
- **Performance:** In-memory caching, async operations

### Performance Requirements
- MCP context retrieval: <200ms response time
- Web portal responsiveness: <2 seconds page load
- File system operations: Optimized for concurrent access
- System availability: 99%+ uptime during testing

## Success Criteria

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Working file system with complete user isolation
- [ ] MCP server responding <200ms with real context data
- [ ] Web portal enabling full user onboarding flow
- [ ] End-to-end integration: signup → create project → AI retrieves context

### Functional Validation
- [ ] Users can signup and receive authentication keys
- [ ] Projects can be created from module templates
- [ ] AI assistants can connect and retrieve rich context
- [ ] Context browsing provides clear visibility into user data
- [ ] System handles multiple concurrent users

### Demo Readiness
- [ ] Complete user flow demonstration
- [ ] AI assistant integration showing "magic moments"
- [ ] Clear value proposition visibility
- [ ] Stable performance under demo conditions

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **File System Performance:** Implement caching and async operations
- **MCP Protocol Complexity:** Use official TypeScript SDK
- **User Isolation:** Validate folder-based security model
- **Template Processing:** Test variable substitution thoroughly

### Development Risks
- **Time Constraints:** Focus on core functionality, defer nice-to-have features
- **Integration Challenges:** Test each component independently first
- **Performance Requirements:** Build with optimization from start

## Implementation Notes

### Development Order Rationale
1. **Data System First:** Everything depends on reliable file operations
2. **MCP Server Second:** Core value proposition is AI integration
3. **Web Portal Last:** User interface builds on proven backend

### Quality Assurance
- Each step must pass independent testing before proceeding
- Integration testing at each step boundary
- Performance validation throughout development
- User experience validation in final step

### Deployment Considerations
- Simple file system deployment for MVP
- Minimal infrastructure requirements ($200-500 budget)
- Local development environment setup
- Basic monitoring and logging
