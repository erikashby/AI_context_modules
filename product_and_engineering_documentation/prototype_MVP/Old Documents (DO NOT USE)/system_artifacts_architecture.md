# Personal Effectiveness Intelligence - Major System Artifacts
*Date: July 26, 2025*
*System Architecture Overview*

## Major System Components

### **1. ConaaS MCP Server** 
**Purpose:** Core context intelligence engine that AI assistants connect to
**Technology:** Node.js with @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
**Key Functions:**
- Provides structured personal effectiveness context to AI assistants
- Implements MCP tools for focus optimization, time management, overwhelm support
- Real-time context retrieval (<200ms response time)
- Stateless architecture for reliable AI assistant connections

**MCP Interface:**
- Tools: `get_focus_recommendations()`, `analyze_time_block()`, `prioritize_overwhelm()`
- Resources: Current priorities, energy patterns, project status
- Prompts: Effectiveness coaching, focus optimization, overwhelm management

### **2. Web Portal (User Management & Dashboard)**
**Purpose:** User signup, account management, and context oversight
**Technology:** React/Next.js web application
**Key Functions:**
- User registration and authentication (OAuth with Google)
- Personal effectiveness dashboard and insights
- Project and priority management interface
- Settings, preferences, and privacy controls
- Billing and subscription management

**Core Pages:**
- Landing page and signup flow
- Onboarding wizard (calendar connection, preferences setup)
- Dashboard (daily focus, upcoming priorities, effectiveness insights)
- Projects management (add/edit projects, deadlines, priorities)
- Settings (integrations, privacy, AI assistant preferences)
- Account management (billing, subscription, data export)

### **3. Context Intelligence Engine**
**Purpose:** Pattern learning and personal effectiveness analysis
**Technology:** Python/Node.js backend service
**Key Functions:**
- Calendar event analysis and meeting preparation insights
- Productivity pattern detection (energy levels, optimal work times)
- Personal effectiveness scoring and recommendations
- Context synthesis for AI assistant consumption

**Intelligence Capabilities:**
- Time-of-day productivity analysis
- Meeting fatigue and preparation requirements
- Task complexity vs. available time/energy matching
- Overwhelm detection and prioritization algorithms
- Weekly/daily structure optimization

### **4. Data Integration Layer**
**Purpose:** Secure connection to user's productivity data sources
**Technology:** RESTful API services with OAuth implementations
**Key Functions:**
- Google Calendar integration (events, availability, patterns)
- Secure credential management and token refresh
- Real-time data synchronization
- Data privacy and permission management

**Supported Integrations (Initial):**
- Google Calendar (read access for events and availability)
- Manual project/priority input (via web portal)
- Future: Email integration, task management tools, communication platforms

### **5. Context Database**
**Purpose:** Secure storage of personal effectiveness data and learned patterns
**Technology:** PostgreSQL with encryption at rest
**Key Functions:**
- User profiles and preferences storage
- Calendar events and meeting analysis storage
- Productivity patterns and effectiveness scores
- Project context and priority tracking
- Historical data for pattern learning

**Data Categories:**
- User authentication and profile data
- Calendar events and meeting metadata
- Personal projects and priorities
- Productivity patterns and energy levels
- Effectiveness scores and recommendations history

### **6. API Gateway & Security Layer**
**Purpose:** Secure API access and traffic management
**Technology:** Express.js with authentication middleware
**Key Functions:**
- API authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Request routing and load balancing
- Security monitoring and audit logging

**Security Features:**
- OAuth 2.1 + PKCE for secure integrations
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Granular permissions for AI assistant access
- Audit trails for all data access

### **7. Monitoring & Analytics System**
**Purpose:** System health monitoring and user analytics
**Technology:** Application monitoring and analytics platform
**Key Functions:**
- System performance and availability monitoring
- User engagement and usage analytics
- Error tracking and alerting
- Business metrics and growth tracking

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
- MCP server response times and availability
- Web portal performance and user flows
- Integration health and sync status
- Customer usage patterns and satisfaction metrics

## Deployment Architecture

### **Production Infrastructure:**
- **MCP Server:** Deployed on Railway/Render with auto-scaling
- **Web Portal:** Static hosting (Vercel/Netlify) with API backend
- **Context Intelligence:** Containerized microservice (Docker on cloud provider)
- **Database:** Managed PostgreSQL (PlanetScale/Supabase)
- **API Gateway:** Edge functions or managed API gateway service

### **Development Environment:**
- Local development setup with Docker Compose
- Staging environment mirroring production
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## Integration Points

### **External Dependencies:**
- Google Calendar API (OAuth 2.1 integration)
- Anthropic Claude (MCP client testing and primary use case)
- Payment processing (Stripe for subscriptions)
- Email service (transactional emails and support)

### **Internal Communication:**
- REST APIs between web portal and backend services
- Direct database connections for context intelligence engine
- MCP protocol for AI assistant communication
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates (future)

## Data Flow Summary

1. **User Setup:** Web portal → OAuth with Google → Calendar sync → Context database
2. **Pattern Learning:** Data integration → Context intelligence → Pattern storage
3. **AI Request:** AI assistant → MCP server → Context retrieval → Intelligent response
