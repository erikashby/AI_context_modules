# Phase 1 Deep Research Prompt

## Research Objective
Conduct comprehensive research to define the core concept and value proposition for an AI Context Service (ConaaS) that will serve as the foundation for creating a PRFAQ document.

## STEP 1: Review Existing Documentation
**CRITICAL:** Before conducting external research, thoroughly review all existing Phase 0 documentation to understand the current vision, mission, values, target market analysis, and success metrics.

**Required Reading:**
- Vision Statement (`vision_and_strategy/vision_statement.md`)
- Mission Statement (`vision_and_strategy/mission_statement.md`) 
- Core Values (`vision_and_strategy/core_values.md`)
- Target Market & Customers (`vision_and_strategy/target_market_customers.md`)
- Success Metrics & KPIs (`vision_and_strategy/success_metrics_kpis.md`)

**Analysis Required:**
- What has already been defined vs. what needs deeper research?
- Which assumptions from Phase 0 need market validation?
- What gaps exist in our current understanding?
- How can external research build on and validate existing work?

**Output:** Summary of existing foundation and research gaps to address

## STEP 2: External Research

## Background Context
We are building Context as a Service (ConaaS) - a structured, persistent AI context service built on Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP). The service stores and retrieves rich contextual data (meetings, projects, user preferences, etc.) in a standardized, schema-driven way, allowing AI assistants to instantly access task-relevant context across sessions.

**Key Concept:** Rather than generic memory storage, this creates a comprehensive MCP server that integrates multiple user data sources and serves them in a consistent schema optimized for AI consumption - enabling cross-session AI planning and decision-making.

## Research Areas

### 1. Problem Definition Research
**Research Question:** What specific AI context challenges does this solve?

**Required Analysis:**
- Current limitations of AI assistants in maintaining context across sessions
- Specific pain points users experience with AI "amnesia"
- Gap analysis between existing AI memory solutions and user needs
- Impact of context loss on AI usefulness and user productivity
- Real-world scenarios where context continuity would dramatically improve AI assistance

**Deliverable:** Comprehensive problem statement with specific, quantified challenges

### 2. Target User Research
**Research Question:** Who needs persistent AI context and why?

**Required Analysis:**
- Market segments that would benefit most from AI context services
- User personas who experience significant AI context pain points
- Use case analysis for different professional categories
- Willingness to pay analysis for context-aware AI
- User behavior patterns with current AI tools
- Decision-making criteria for adopting new AI infrastructure

**Deliverable:** Refined target user profiles with specific needs, behaviors, and value drivers

### 3. Competitive Landscape Research
**Research Question:** What makes this better than current solutions?

**Required Analysis:**
- Existing AI memory and context solutions in the market
- Technical approaches to AI context (RAG, fine-tuning, prompt engineering, etc.)
- Limitations of current solutions (technical, user experience, business model)
- Differentiation opportunities for MCP-based approach
- Competitive advantages of structured context vs. unstructured memory
- Market positioning opportunities

**Deliverable:** Clear competitive differentiation and unique value proposition

### 4. Technical Concept Research
**Research Question:** How does an AI context service work at a high level?

**Required Analysis:**
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) capabilities and adoption
- AI context architecture patterns and best practices
- User experience flows for context capture and retrieval
- Integration patterns with major AI platforms
- Technical requirements for sub-200ms context retrieval
- Schema design principles for AI-optimized context

**Deliverable:** High-level technical concept that is understandable to non-technical stakeholders

### 5. Success Metrics Research
**Research Question:** What would "working well" look like for users?

**Required Analysis:**
- User success metrics for AI productivity tools
- Context quality measures and user satisfaction indicators
- Technical performance benchmarks for context services
- Business metrics for context-aware AI adoption
- User behavior changes that indicate value realization
- Long-term success criteria for ConaaS platform

**Deliverable:** Clear success definition with measurable outcomes

### 6. Market Validation Research
**Research Question:** Is there sufficient market demand and opportunity?

**Required Analysis:**
- Market size estimates for AI context services
- Current spending on AI productivity tools
- Enterprise adoption patterns for AI infrastructure
- Pricing models for B2B AI services
- Go-to-market strategies for AI infrastructure companies
- Funding landscape for AI productivity tools

**Deliverable:** Market opportunity assessment with validation approach

## Research Instructions

### Research Methodology
- Use web search to find current information about AI context, memory, and productivity tools
- Analyze existing solutions, user feedback, and market reports
- Research technical capabilities of MCP and related technologies
- Find case studies and user stories about AI context challenges
- Look for pricing and adoption data for similar AI infrastructure services

### Output Format
For each research area, provide:
1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 paragraphs)
2. **Key Findings** (bullet points with supporting evidence)
3. **Supporting Data** (statistics, quotes, examples)
4. **Sources** (links and references)
5. **Implications** (what this means for our concept)

### Quality Standards
- Use recent sources (2023-2025 preferred)
- Cite all claims with specific sources
- Focus on actionable insights rather than general information
- Quantify findings wherever possible
- Balance optimism with realistic market assessment

## Expected Deliverable
A comprehensive research report covering all 6 areas that provides the foundation for creating a compelling PRFAQ document. The research should give clear answers to:

1. **Problem:** What specific challenge are we solving?
2. **Users:** Who has this problem and why do they care?
3. **Solution:** What makes our approach uniquely valuable?
4. **Concept:** How does it work from a user perspective?
5. **Success:** How will we know it's working?
6. **Market:** Is there sufficient opportunity to build a business?

The research should be thorough enough that someone could write a convincing PRFAQ based solely on the research findings.
