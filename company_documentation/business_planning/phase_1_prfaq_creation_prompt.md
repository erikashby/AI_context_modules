# Phase 1 PRFAQ Creation Prompt

## Objective
Transform the deep research findings into a compelling Press Release + FAQ (PRFAQ) document for the AI Context Service (ConaaS) that captures the complete concept and serves as the foundation for Phase 2 prototype development.

## Required Reading and Input

### STEP 1: Read All Project Documentation
**CRITICAL:** First read all existing project documentation to understand the complete context.

**Project Root Path:** `/home/erik/github/AI_context_service_private/`

**Required Reading (in order):**
1. **Main README.md** - Project overview and structure
2. **All Phase 0 Documents:**
   - `company_documentation/vision_and_strategy/vision_statement.md`
   - `company_documentation/vision_and_strategy/mission_statement.md`
   - `company_documentation/vision_and_strategy/core_values.md`
   - `company_documentation/vision_and_strategy/target_market_customers.md`
   - `company_documentation/vision_and_strategy/success_metrics_kpis.md`
3. **Planning Documents:**
   - `company_documentation/business_planning/company_development_plan.md`
   - `company_documentation/business_planning/project_tracking.md`

### STEP 2: Use Market Research Report as Primary Input
**PRIMARY INPUT:** The `market_research_report` document that contains the key research findings from the deep research phase.

**This report should contain:**
1. Problem definition and user pain points
2. Target user analysis and market insights  
3. Competitive landscape and differentiation
4. Technical concept and approach
5. Success metrics and validation criteria
6. Market opportunity assessment

**Integration Approach:**
- Use the market research report as the primary source for PRFAQ content
- Cross-reference with Phase 0 documents to ensure consistency
- Build on existing vision/mission/values rather than contradicting them
- Validate that research findings align with established target market

- How do you ensure data privacy and security?
- What's the business model?

**Competitive Questions:**
- How is this better than existing AI memory solutions?
- What about built-in AI assistant memory features?
- Why not just use better prompting techniques?
- How does this compare to [specific competitors from research]?

**Implementation Questions:**
- How hard is it to set up and use?
- What data sources can it connect to?
- Do I need technical skills to use it?
- How long does it take to see value?

**Future Questions:**
- What's on the roadmap?
- Will you support team/enterprise features?
- What about integrations with [specific tools]?
- How will this evolve with AI advancement?

## Writing Guidelines

### Tone & Style:
- **Professional but accessible** - avoid overly technical language
- **Confident but not overhyped** - based on real research and capabilities
- **Customer-focused** - emphasize user benefits over technical features
- **Concrete and specific** - use real examples and scenarios from research

### Content Principles:
- **Evidence-based** - all claims should be supported by research findings
- **Realistic** - avoid unrealistic promises or market projections
- **Differentiated** - clearly explain why this is better than alternatives
- **Actionable** - readers should understand what they can do next

### Quality Standards:
- **Compelling narrative** - should make readers excited about the solution
- **Clear value proposition** - obvious why target users would want this
- **Addresses concerns** - FAQ should handle likely objections and questions
- **Market-ready messaging** - could actually be used for product launch

## Expected Output

A complete PRFAQ document with:
- **Press Release** (500-800 words) that tells a compelling product story
- **FAQ** (15-25 questions) that addresses all major customer concerns
- **Consistent messaging** throughout that reflects research findings
- **Market-ready content** that could guide actual product positioning

The PRFAQ should serve as the definitive concept document that anyone could read to understand:
1. What we're building and why it matters
2. Who it's for and what problems it solves  
3. How it works and what makes it unique
4. Why customers should care and what they get
5. How to get started and what comes next

## Success Criteria

The completed PRFAQ should:
- [ ] Clearly articulate the AI Context Service concept
- [ ] Demonstrate strong understanding of target users and their needs
- [ ] Position the solution compellingly against alternatives
- [ ] Address major customer questions and concerns
- [ ] Provide clear direction for Phase 2 prototype development
- [ ] Feel like a real product announcement that would generate interest

**Note:** Base all content on the research findings provided. Do not make assumptions or add information not supported by the research data.
