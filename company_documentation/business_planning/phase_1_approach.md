# Phase 1 Approach - Concept Definition

## Phase 1 Overview
**Goal:** Clarify the core concept and value proposition through structured concept definition work, culminating in a PRFAQ document.

**Timeline:** [TO BE DETERMINED]

**Key Activities from Company Development Plan:**
1. Define the problem: What specific AI context challenges does this solve?
2. Identify the target users: Who needs persistent AI context? (developers, power users, enterprises?)
3. Articulate the value proposition: What makes this better than current solutions?
4. Describe the basic concept: How does an AI context service work at a high level?
5. Define success: What would "working well" look like for users?
6. Produce a PRFAQ document that captures the complete concept

## Proposed Approach

### Step 1: Problem Definition Workshop
**Objective:** Clearly articulate the specific AI context challenges we're solving

**Activities:**
- Review existing problem statements in Phase 0 documents
- Refine and focus the problem definition based on target user insights
- Document specific pain points with current AI assistant limitations
- Identify the gap between current AI memory solutions and what users need

**Deliverable:** Focused problem statement document

### Step 2: Target User Refinement
**Objective:** Validate and refine our understanding of who needs this solution

**Activities:**
- Review Phase 0 personas and market analysis
- Focus on the primary user segment for the concept definition
- Define specific user scenarios and use cases
- Clarify user jobs-to-be-done for the concept

**Deliverable:** Refined target user profile for concept validation

### Step 3: Value Proposition Development
**Objective:** Articulate what makes our approach better than alternatives

**Activities:**
- Analyze current AI memory and context solutions
- Define our unique approach and differentiators
- Quantify the value we provide to users
- Develop clear before/after user experience scenarios

**Deliverable:** Clear value proposition statement

### Step 4: Concept Definition
**Objective:** Describe how the AI context service works at a high level

**Activities:**
- Define the core concept of Context as a Service (ConaaS)
- Outline the basic user and AI client flows
- Describe the key components without technical implementation details
- Clarify what success looks like from user perspective

**Deliverable:** High-level concept description

### Step 5: Success Definition
**Objective:** Define what "working well" means for users

**Activities:**
- Define user success criteria
- Establish quality measures for context service
- Identify key user experience improvements
- Set expectations for concept validation

**Deliverable:** Success criteria definition

### Step 6: PRFAQ Creation
**Objective:** Synthesize all concept work into a compelling PRFAQ document

**Activities:**
- Write press release announcing the AI Context Service
- Develop FAQ addressing key customer questions and concerns
- Validate the concept story through the PRFAQ format
- Refine messaging and positioning

**Deliverable:** Complete PRFAQ document

**Decision-Making:** [TO BE DETERMINED BY ERIK]
- Will Erik make final decisions after discussion?
- Should we use collaborative iteration?
- What level of detail is needed before moving to next step?

### Documentation
**Format:** Markdown documents for each deliverable
**Location:** [TO BE DETERMINED]
**Review Process:** [TO BE DETERMINED]

### Timeline
**Duration per Step:** [TO BE DETERMINED]
**Total Phase 1 Timeline:** [TO BE DETERMINED]
**Milestones:** [TO BE DETERMINED]

## Success Criteria for Phase 1

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] All 6 key activities completed with documented deliverables
- [ ] PRFAQ document created and approved
- [ ] Concept clarity sufficient to move to Phase 2 prototype planning
- [ ] Erik approval of Phase 1 completion

### Quality Measures
- **Concept Clarity:** Can the concept be explained clearly in under 2 minutes?
- **User Focus:** Is the value proposition compelling to target users?
- **Differentiation:** Is our approach clearly better than alternatives?
- **Actionability:** Does the concept provide clear direction for Phase 2?

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this approach document
2. Determine decision-making process for Phase 1
3. Set timeline and session structure
4. Begin Step 1: Problem Definition Workshop

## Questions for Erik
- How should we make decisions during Phase 1 concept work?
- What level of detail do you want for each step before moving forward?
- Should we work through all steps in sequence or iterate across them?
- Where should we store the Phase 1 deliverable documents?
- What timeline are you targeting for Phase 1 completion?
