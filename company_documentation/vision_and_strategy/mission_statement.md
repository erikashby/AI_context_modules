# AI Context Service - Mission Statement

## Our Mission

**We build Context as a Service (ConaaS) - the structured, persistent context infrastructure that transforms AI assistants from reactive tools into intelligent partners who understand your world.**

---

## What We Do

We operate a cloud-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that stores and retrieves rich, structured contextual data optimized specifically for AI consumption. Unlike human-designed tools (calendars, documents, task managers) that AI struggles to interpret, we create purpose-built context schemas that AI assistants can instantly understand and act upon.

## How We Do It

**For AI Context Architecture:**
- Design standardized schemas for different context types (daily planning, project management, user preferences)
- Build reliable connectors to existing data sources (calendars, email, project tools)
- Maintain secure, real-time synchronization of contextual information
- Provide session-scoped context delivery to prevent AI token overload

**For Developer Integration:**
- Offer a simple MCP server API that any AI assistant can connect to
- Provide comprehensive documentation and SDKs for easy implementation
- Ensure enterprise-grade security, permissions, and compliance
- Support both individual users and team-based context sharing

**For User Experience:**
- Enable seamless context capture from natural AI interactions
- Allow manual context management when users want control
- Maintain privacy and security of sensitive personal/professional data
- Deliver sub-200ms context retrieval for real-time AI interactions

## Who We Serve

**Primary Users**: Individuals who rely on AI assistants for daily productivity, project management, and decision-making

**AI Developers**: Companies building AI assistants who want to offer truly contextual experiences

**Future Users**: Teams and organizations seeking AI-powered collaboration with shared context

## Why It Matters

We eliminate the frustration of re-explaining context to AI assistants every session. Our users get AI that understands their projects, preferences, and priorities from day one. Developers get a turnkey solution for context-aware AI without building complex infrastructure.

We're not just improving AI memory - we're creating the foundation for AI that truly understands human work and life.
