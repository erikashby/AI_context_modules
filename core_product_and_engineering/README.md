# Core Product and Engineering

This folder contains foundational technical documentation that spans across project phases, providing the core architectural and product specifications for the AI Context Service.

## Purpose
Houses cross-phase technical architecture, system design, feature specifications, and engineering standards that guide implementation throughout the entire project lifecycle.

## When to Reference
- Technical architecture discussions and decisions
- Feature specification and design
- System integration planning
- Engineering standards and patterns
- Cross-phase technical consistency

## Folder Structure
- **architecture_and_design/** - Technical architecture, system design, data schemas, and core technical decisions
- **features/** - Product feature specifications and design documents

## Relationship to Project Phases
This documentation serves as the foundation that informs phase-specific implementation work found in the `project_phases/` folder. While phases contain temporal progression and implementation details, this folder contains the enduring technical specifications and architectural decisions.

## Usage Guidelines
- Reference when making technical architecture decisions
- Update when core system design changes
- Use for maintaining consistency across development phases
- Maintain as living documentation that evolves with system understanding
