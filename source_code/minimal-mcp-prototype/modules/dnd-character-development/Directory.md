To build a character: start from the PHB Creating a Character .md, and supplement the races mentioned with the race traits from Minecraft DND Race stats and build .md, and the class file, and the spell lists linked. It is also important that you read and review PHB How To Play, to understand how D&D functions as a ttrpg.  Any information should be linked from the classes, equipment, background and spells files, however if you do not have sufficient information to continue with the character creation process, stop and alert me.
When creating a character, you need to approach it one step at a time. do not continue to the next step until I have approved and have stated that I am ready to move on. You may suggest fitting backgrounds or spells, but you may not decide on the character for me. You may copy the character sheet template and continuously update it after every step.
