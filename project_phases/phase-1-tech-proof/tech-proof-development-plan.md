# Tech-Proof Development Plan
## Context Navigation System Implementation

**Date**: 2025-07-12  
**Engineering Lead**: Senior Developer (AI Assistant)  
**Product Requirements**: Based on `tech-proof-user-story.md`  
**Status**: ✅ **APPROVED** - Ready for Implementation

**Approval**: Product Owner approved 2025-07-12 - Proceed with Phase 0 backup and implementation

---

## Executive Summary

This plan upgrades our proven stateless MCP server from basic `hello`/`echo` validation tools to a **Context Navigation System** that demonstrates intelligent AI assistant navigation of structured user context data.

**Key Innovation**: Present user context as familiar folder structures that AI assistants can explore intuitively, eliminating the need for users to re-explain context in every conversation.

**Business Value**: Validates core ConaaS technology - structured context delivery that transforms AI assistant interactions from stateless to context-aware.

---

## Current State Analysis

### Working Foundation (Preserve)
- ✅ **Stateless Architecture**: `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` with `sessionIdGenerator: undefined`
- ✅ **Render Deployment**: Working at `https://ai-context-service-private.onrender.com/mcp`
- ✅ **Claude Desktop Integration**: Verified connection and tool execution
- ✅ **MCP Protocol**: Proper JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation

### Current Tools (Replace)
- `hello` - Simple greeting with name parameter
- `echo` - Message echo-back functionality

**Engineering Decision**: Preserve entire transport architecture, replace only tool implementations.

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Phase 0: Backup Working Implementation (CRITICAL)
**Scope**: Preserve current working `server-stateless.js` as reference baseline  
**Approach**: Create backup copy before ANY modifications  
**Risk**: CRITICAL - Without backup, we lose our only proven working model

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Copy `server-stateless.js` to `server-stateless-BACKUP-hello-echo.js`
2. Verify backup contains complete working implementation
3. Document backup as "PROVEN WORKING - Hello/Echo tools with Claude Desktop"
4. Ensure backup can be restored by updating `package.json` start script

### Phase 1: Core Tool Implementation (30 min)
**Scope**: Replace `hello`/`echo` tools with 4 context navigation tools  
**Approach**: Preserve stateless architecture, modify only tool handlers  
**Risk**: Low - isolated changes with backup available

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create new `server-context.js` based on backup
2. Update `createServer()` function tool definitions
3. Replace tool handlers with context navigation logic
4. Add input validation and error handling
5. Update server metadata (name, version, capabilities)

### Phase 2: Mock Context Data Structure (Day 1-2)
**Scope**: Create realistic sample data following specified folder structure  
**Approach**: JSON-based filesystem simulation  

**Required Structure**:
```
personal-organization/
├── README.md                    # Project overview
├── current-status/
│   ├── priorities.md           # Current top priorities  
│   ├── this-week.md           # Weekly focus and schedule
│   └── decisions-pending.md    # Pending decisions
├── planning/2025/2025-07-06/   # Current week folder
│   ├── weekly_notes_2025-07-06.md
│   ├── daily_notes_2025-07-11.md  # Today
│   └── [other daily files]
├── projects/
│   ├── active/                 # 2-3 sample active projects
│   ├── planning/               # Projects in planning
│   └── completed/              # Completed projects
└── goals-and-vision/
    ├── annual-goals.md         # 2025 main objectives
    ├── quarterly-focus.md      # Q3 2025 priorities
    └── life-vision.md          # Long-term direction
```

### Phase 3: Error Handling & Edge Cases (Day 2)
**Scope**: Robust error handling for production-like behavior  

**Error Cases**:
- Invalid project_id
- Non-existent folder paths
- File not found
- "Not implemented yet" for personal-health project
- Path traversal prevention (security)

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Day 2-3)
**Scope**: Comprehensive testing before deployment  

**Test Scenarios**:
1. **Tool Functionality**: Each tool works independently
2. **AI Workflow**: Full navigation sequence (list → explore → read)
3. **Claude Desktop Integration**: End-to-end user experience
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes
5. **Performance**: Sub-200ms response times

## Sample Content Strategy

### Realistic Context Data
Create believable sample content that demonstrates clear value over "explain everything" conversations.

**Content Themes**:
- **Work Projects**: Johnson presentation, budget planning, team meetings
- **Personal Life**: Family commitments, health goals, social activities  
- **Planning**: Weekly schedules, daily priorities, decision tracking
- **Goals**: Annual objectives, quarterly focus areas, life vision

**Content Quality Standards**:
- Specific and detailed (not generic)
- Interconnected (references between files)
- Time-relevant (current dates and schedules)
- Action-oriented (clear next steps and decisions)

### Key Sample Files

**`current-status/priorities.md`**: 
- Top 3 work priorities with deadlines
- Personal commitments this week
- Health and fitness current focus

**`planning/2025/2025-07-06/daily_notes_2025-07-11.md`** (Today):
- Morning schedule and key meetings
- Afternoon focus blocks
- Evening personal commitments
- Tomorrow's preparation items

**`projects/active/johnson-presentation/`**:
- Project overview and deadline
- Current status and next actions
- Required resources and dependencies

## Appendix: Expected AI Workflow Demo

**User Scenario**: "Help me plan my day"

**AI Navigation Sequence**:
1. `list_projects()` → Discovers "personal-organization" available
2. `explore_project("personal-organization")` → Understands folder structure
3. `list_folder_contents("personal-organization", "current-status")` → Sees priorities, weekly focus
4. `read_file("personal-organization", "current-status/priorities.md")` → Gets current priorities
5. `read_file("personal-organization", "planning/2025/2025-07-06/weekly_notes_2025-07-06.md")` → Gets weekly context
6. `read_file("personal-organization", "planning/2025/2025-07-06/daily_notes_2025-07-11.md")` → Gets today's context

**AI Response**: Intelligent daily planning based on actual priorities, weekly objectives, and today's schedule - demonstrating clear value over "explain everything" conversations.
