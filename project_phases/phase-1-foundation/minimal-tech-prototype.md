# Minimal Tech Prototype Plan

## Objective
Build a minimal remote MCP server to validate core technical feasibility - specifically that remote MCP connections work reliably with Claude and ChatGPT without authentication complexity.

## Scope

### What We're Validating
- Remote MCP server connectivity to Claude Desktop and ChatGPT
- Basic context retrieval functionality
- Connection reliability and latency
- JSON-RPC 2.0 message handling
- Transport layer stability (HTTP+SSE and/or Streamable HTTP)

### What We're NOT Including
- Authentication/authorization (OAuth 2.1)
- Real user data integration (calendar, email)
- Complex context schemas
- Database persistence
- Error handling beyond basic functionality
- Production-ready deployment

## Technical Architecture

### Server Components
1. **MCP Server Core**
   - Node.js + Express.js framework
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 message handling
   - Basic transport support (prioritize Streamable HTTP)

2. **Mock Context Data**
   - Hardcoded sample context (meetings, projects, preferences)
   - Simple JSON structures mimicking real context schema
   - Demonstrates context retrieval patterns

3. **MCP Primitives Implementation**
   - **Resources**: Sample user context data
   - **Tools**: Basic context query functions
   - **Prompts**: Simple context-aware templates

### Client Testing
- **Claude Desktop**: Test remote MCP server connection
- **ChatGPT**: Test remote MCP server connection (if supported)
- **Manual Testing**: Validate context retrieval in AI conversations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic MCP Server
- [ ] Set up Node.js MCP server using official SDK
- [ ] Implement basic JSON-RPC 2.0 message handling
- [ ] Add hardcoded mock context data
- [ ] Deploy to simple hosting platform (Vercel/Railway)

### Phase 2: Context Primitives
- [ ] Implement Resources primitive (user context data)
- [ ] Implement Tools primitive (context query functions)
- [ ] Add basic logging and debugging
- [ ] Test local MCP server functionality

### Phase 3: Remote Connection Testing
- [ ] Configure Claude Desktop to connect to remote server
- [ ] Test ChatGPT remote MCP connection
- [ ] Validate context retrieval in AI conversations
- [ ] Document connection setup processes

### Phase 4: Reliability Testing
- [ ] Test connection persistence and reconnection
- [ ] Measure response latency
- [ ] Test concurrent connection handling
- [ ] Document reliability characteristics

  }
}
```

## Success Criteria

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Remote MCP server successfully connects to Claude Desktop
- [ ] ChatGPT can connect to remote MCP server (if supported)
- [ ] AI assistants can retrieve and use context data
- [ ] Connection remains stable during conversation
- [ ] Response latency under 2 seconds

### Business Validation
- [ ] AI responses demonstrate understanding of context
- [ ] Context significantly improves AI helpfulness
- [ ] Connection reliability meets product requirements
- [ ] Setup process is reasonable for end users

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Connection Failures**: Test multiple hosting platforms
- **Latency Issues**: Implement basic caching and optimization
- **Transport Compatibility**: Support both HTTP+SSE and Streamable HTTP if needed

### Fallback Plans
- **Local MCP First**: If remote fails, validate with local MCP server
- **Single AI Assistant**: Focus on Claude if ChatGPT support is limited
- **Simplified Context**: Reduce mock data complexity if performance issues

## Deliverables

1. **Working Remote MCP Server**
   - Deployed and accessible via public URL
   - Basic context data and query functionality

2. **Connection Documentation**
   - Setup instructions for Claude Desktop
   - Setup instructions for ChatGPT (if supported)
   - Troubleshooting guide

3. **Validation Report**
   - Connection reliability test results
   - Performance metrics
   - AI assistant behavior with context
   - Recommendations for next steps

## Development Approach
**AI-Assisted Development**: Using AI tools to accelerate implementation
- **Phase 1-2**: Server implementation and basic testing
- **Phase 3**: Remote connection setup and validation
- **Phase 4**: Reliability testing and documentation

## Next Steps After Prototype
If validation succeeds:
1. Complete remaining technical investigation (1.3, 1.4)
2. Design production architecture with authentication
3. Plan MVP development roadmap

If validation fails:
1. Analyze failure modes and technical limitations
2. Evaluate alternative approaches or architecture changes
3. Reassess business model feasibility
