## üîÑ Issue Workflow

### **When Issue is Found**:
1. Erik reports issue with details
2. AI Assistant logs issue using template above
3. Categorize severity and Phase 2 impact
4. Decide: Fix immediately or batch for later

### **For Critical Issues**:
- Stop current work
- Fix immediately
- Retest affected functionality
- Update issue status to resolved

### **For Non-Critical Issues**:
- Log for batch processing
- Continue with UAT testing
- Schedule fix during Phase 2 development
- Update issue status when resolved

## üìà Issue Tracking Guidelines

### **Severity Definitions**:

**Critical**: 
- Breaks core MCP functionality
- Prevents users from accessing their data
- Security vulnerabilities
- Blocks Phase 2 development

**High**: 
- Significant performance degradation
- Major feature not working as expected
- User experience severely impacted
- May impact Phase 2 if not addressed

**Medium**:
- Minor feature issues
- Performance could be better
- User experience could be improved
- Cosmetic issues with functional impact

**Low**:
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Minor cosmetic issues
- Edge cases that rarely occur
- Documentation gaps

### **Phase 2 Blocking Criteria**:
An issue blocks Phase 2 if:
- It breaks existing MCP server functionality
- It compromises user data security/isolation
- It prevents new user onboarding workflows
- It makes the system unstable for production use

**Instructions for Erik**:
When you find an issue during UAT testing, just describe it and I'll log it using the template above. We'll categorize it together and decide on the fix priority.

**Instructions for AI Assistant**:
Log each issue Erik reports using the template. Keep the summary section updated. Mark issues as resolved when fixes are implemented and verified.
